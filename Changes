  [ BUG FIXES ]
    - add test for 'cache_remove'
    - Change log was messed up by dzil plugin

  [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
    - add 'before_create_cache' hook
    - now http headers of cached response are saved as well, and we're not
      using 'halt' anymore. (patch by Perlover)
    - new configuration option 'honor_no_cache' for client-side
      'Cache-Control: no-cache' or 'Pragma: no-cache'. (original patch and
      idea by Perlover)
    - cache keys used by 'cache_page' can be customized via
      'cache_page_key_generator'.
